# Cultural Diversity Analysis of India

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the cultural diversity of India using data from the 2011 Indian Census. The aim was to compute diversity indices for various aspects such as occupational classification, religious communities, language groups, and migration patterns across different states in India. By applying Simpson’s and Shannon’s diversity indices, we quantified and visualized the diversity across these dimensions, providing a comprehensive view of India's cultural richness.

## Key Highlights
- **Objective**: To compute diversity indices that reflect the occupational, linguistic, religious, and migration diversity across Indian states, helping to understand the cultural fabric of the country.
- **Data**: Analysis was based on publicly available datasets from the 2011 Indian Census.
- **Methodology**: The project utilized Simpson’s and Shannon’s diversity indices to quantify diversity, followed by exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques.
- **Findings**: States like Manipur, Nagaland, and Jammu & Kashmir emerged as highly diverse across various indices, highlighting their unique cultural compositions.
